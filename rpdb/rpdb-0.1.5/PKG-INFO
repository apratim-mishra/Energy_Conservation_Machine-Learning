Description: rpdb - remote debugger based on pdb
        ==================================
        
        rpbm is a wrapper around pdb that re-routes stdin and stdout to a socket
        handler. By default it opens the debugger on port 4444::
        
            import rpdb; rpdb.set_trace()
        
        But you can change that by simply instantiating Rpdb manually::
        
            import rpdb
            debugger = rpdb.Rpdb(12345)
            debugger.set_trace()
        
        It is known to work on Jython 2.5 to 2.7, Python 2.5 to 3.1. It was written
        originally for Jython since this is pretty much the only way to debug it when
        running it on Tomcat.
        
        Upon reaching `set_trace()`, your script will "hang" and the only way to get it
        to continue is to access rpdb using telnet, netcat, etc..::
        
            nc 127.0.0.1 4444
        
        Installation in CPython (standard Python)
        -----------------------------------------
        
            pip install rpdb
        
        For a quick, ad hoc alternative, you can copy the entire rpdb subdirectory
        (the directory directly containing the __init.py file) to somewhere on your
        $PYTHONPATH.
        
        Installation in a Tomcat webapp
        -------------------------------
        
        Just copy the rpdb directory (the one with the __init__.py file) in your
        WEB-INF/lib/Lib folder along with the standard Jython library (required).
        
        Known bugs
        ----------
          - The socket is not always closed properly so you will need to ^C in netcat
            and Esc+q in telnet to exit after a continue or quit.
          - There is a bug in Jython 2.5/pdb that causes rpdb to stop on ghost
            breakpoints after you continue ('c'), this is fixed in 2.7b1.

        0.1.5 (2014-10-16)
        ==================
        
         - Write addr/port to stderr instead of stdout (thanks to @onlynone).
         - Allow for dynamic host port (thanks to @onlynone).
         - Make q/quit do proper cleanup (@kenmanheimer)
         - Benignly disregard repeated rpdb.set_trace() to same port as currently
           active session (@kenmanheimer)
         - Extend backwards compatibility down to Python 2.5 (@kenmanheimer)
        
        0.1.4 (2014-04-28)
        ==================
        
         - Expose the addr, port arguments to the set_trace method (thanks to @niedbalski).
        
        0.1.3 (2013-08-02)
        ==================
        
         - Remove a try/finally that seemed to shift the trace location (thanks to k4ml@github).
        
        0.1.2 (2012-01-26)
        ==================
        
         - Catch IOError raised by print in initialization, it may not work in some
           environments (e.g. mod_wsgi). (Menno Smits)
